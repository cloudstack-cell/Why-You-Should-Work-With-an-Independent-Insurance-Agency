                        Sometimes, you might see advertisements for cheap auto insurance that offers fast, easy enrollment online without the hassle of talking to a pushy salesperson. This might sound like it’s a simple, practical way to get the auto insurance you need as efficiently as possible. However, is it really a wise step to take? Should you really go on your search for coverage all on your own?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In reality, buying insurance is one of the most important times to speak to an agent. After all, car insurance is a very complicated, and to get maximized benefits, you must enroll in the one that is the best fit for you. The easiest way to do so is to work with an independent insurance agent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Independent agencies like Signature Insurance offer you one great perk: choice. They’re also staffed by teams of professionals who are committed to the client’s satisfaction, first and foremost, rather than the sale. That’s why to us, it’s less about pushing you to enroll and more about gaining your trust, so that you can rely on us for all of your auto insurance needs for years to come.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s take a closer look at why independent agencies are the best ways to get personalize auto insurance solutions.

                <h2>Independent Agents Offer Choice</h2>
                <p>
                    There are two types of insurance agents: captive and independent. Captive agents only sell the policies of a single insurance carrier, whereas independent agents are authorized to sell policies for any number of carriers with whom they choose to partner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if you buy your auto policy from a captive agent, then you will only be able to select from the policies that carrier offers, and the choice will be limited. However, an independent agent will be able to extensively compare policies from across a wide network of insurers, and help you determine the one that offers you the right coverage at the most competitive price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In reality, policies from different insurers might look identical in terms of coverage but might actually be priced quite differently. It’s only natural to want a policy that offers you the most value and affordability, and if you only work with a captive agent, then you might not be unlocking the full cost perks that you might be able to obtain from another insurer. Your independent agent will therefore be able to guide you in the direction of coverage that will offer you the best of both worlds.
                </p>
                <h2>Independent Agents Are Community-Focused</h2>
                <p>
                    An independent agency is not a national corporation. It’s a small business operating in the heart of its community. Therefore, its agents are committed not to meeting the carrier’s demands, but to finding the car insurance solutions that are best for their friends and neighbors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since all driving is personal, you’ll want auto insurance that will give you the best possible protection in case of an accident or other loss. With the familiar service offered by an independent agent, you’ll get it. They understand what concerns you have about your policy, and they’re committed to helping you get the solutions you deserve, without the hassle or impersonal feeling of working with a carrier representative that might be hundreds of miles away.
                </p>

                <h2>Independent Agents Are Accessible</h2>
                <p>
                    Rather than being put on hold while you wait to be connected with an agent, independent agencies put responsiveness at the top of their list of priorities. Regardless of whether you need to file a claim, make a change to your coverage, or just have questions about the benefits you have, you’ll be able to get your answer quickly. Since your agent knows you, they’ll be able to give you a personalized answer.
                </p>
                <h2>Independent Agents Are Experts</h2>
                <p>
                    Their familiarity with all types of auto policies make independent agents the people to ask when you have any questions about your coverage. They know all of the tricks of the trade, and they have a wide variety of experience to help them know exactly how to make the recommendations that will be for the client in the end. Since auto insurance must be specific to the driver, it is the agent’s knowledge that ensures that there are never any loophole, lapses or missing pieces when it comes to a driver’s optimized coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, an independent agent is a friend and advisor that you can trust to help you get insurance solutions that are personal. With them, you’ll be able to gain a partner who will be there for you through good times and bad, and will always be ready to help you out if you ever encounter problems with coverage.
